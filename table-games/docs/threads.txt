1) Server  threads:
	Main listener thread just listens fixed port and accepts socket connections.
	Web listener thread listens 8080 port and redirects all connections to the main server.
	Server update thread loads the needed controllers and updates them time to time.

2) Game Threads:
	Main controller thread loads application settings from the database and updates the lobby (controller.updateApp())
	Room worker threads are created inside the room and used to process various game logics. Currenctly there are 2 types of games: 1 thread for whole game (bingo, seka) / 1 thread per player (keno, mixball).
	Socket event handler thread (1 thread per connection) receives message from the network and calls the Controller.messageRecevied method.
	There is also one thread which pings all socket connections.
